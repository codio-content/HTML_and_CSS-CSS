Before continuing, I'd like to demonstrate the power of css!

Have a look at the `raw.html` file on the top left code window.
Nothing fancy, just some titles and some texts.

It is displayed without any styling in the bottom left window.

Now let see what could be done with some css, so we kept exactly the same html structure and just added css .. [Click here](open_preview 4-demo/css1.html panel=1) to preview it .

And if we are even more crazy we can add a lot more css ! [Click here](open_preview 4-demo/css2.html panel=1) to preview it (try to put your mouse over the different elements ...)

So from the same html markup we get totally different looking and behaving results ! That's the power of css ..
