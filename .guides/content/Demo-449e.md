Before continuing, I'd like to demonstrate the power of css! Let's see how css was used to do the tree view of an html document that we used in the previous section.

Imagine we have this html code :
```html
    <h1> some title </h1>
    <p> some text </p>
    
    <h1> another title </h1>
    <p> another text</p>
    
    <h1> our last title</h1>
    <p> and our last text</p>
```

Nothing fancy, just some titles and some texts.
If we display it without any styling, it should look like this :

![Tree empty](.guides/img/iframe1.png)


Now let see what could be done with css, so we keep exactly the same structure and just add css.Now

![With style 1](.guides/img/iframe2.png)

And now we can get really crazy ! :
