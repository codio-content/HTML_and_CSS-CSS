Before continuing, We would like to demonstrate the power of CSS!

Have a look at the `raw.html` file on the top left code window.
Nothing fancy, just some titles and some texts.

It is displayed without any styling in the bottom left window.

### A bit of CSS
Now let see what could be done with some CSS, so we kept exactly the same HTML structure and just added CSS .. [Click here](open_preview 4-demo/css1.html panel=1) to preview it .

### A lot of CSS
And if we are even more crazy we can add a lot more CSS ! [Click here](open_preview 4-demo/css2.html panel=1) to preview it (try to put your mouse over the different elements ...)

So from the same HTML markup we get totally different looking and behaving results ! That's the power of CSS ..
