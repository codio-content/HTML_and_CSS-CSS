# Styling your content with CSS

Until now we have been structuring our content with html tags. This is a title, this is a paragraph, this is an image. We have not really paid attention to the look and feel of our pages. Nevertheless, in today's web, the visual parts of a web page have been getting better and more complex. The visual has become a critical part to a site's success.

Historically there was only HTML, but rapidly the people creating HTML pages discovered that they were repeating the same tags over and over again to apply the same styling to different elements. The process was tedious and repetitive and the HTML documents ended being very big and redundant. Moreover HTML was originally designed to structure content, with the visual part being far less important and largely being left to the browser.

Someone came with a great idea to remove all the styling attributes of the tags and put them in a separate place than the HTML. This would simplify the HTML, allow to reuse the same styles on different elements of a page en even in different pages.
