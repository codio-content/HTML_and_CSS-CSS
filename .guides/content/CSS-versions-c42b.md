Since it was introduced, css has evolved and is now in version 3. It got more and more features along the way, here is a very short history.

### CSS1

The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996
It included many of the basic things, like fonts, colors, text attributes, alignment of text and other elements, margins, borders, padding and positioning for most elements. 


### CSS2

CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, and new font properties such as shadows.

### CSS3

Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.

As of June 2012, there are over fifty CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group, and six of these have been published as formal recommendations, all the others are not formally finished yet.

Here is an overview of all the versions and the current state of CSS3 :
