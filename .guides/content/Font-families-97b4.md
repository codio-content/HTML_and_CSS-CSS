Handling fonts on the web is a difficult problem. The difficulty come from the fact that a font might not be available on the client computer. The fonts are system-based, meaning they are a part of Windows/Mac/Linux. 

Their are 2 ways it is solved :

1) Use the so called "web-safe" fonts (ones that are supposedly available on all systems) and provide a list of fonts instead of just one.

2) Make the browser load a webfont directly so you will be sure it's available, a "webfont" is a special version of a font that is downloadable and usable by the web browsers.
