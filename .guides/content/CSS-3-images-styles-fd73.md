# Adding some cool CSS3 styles

# Rounded corners

Now let's make our images corners more rounded, because it's nicer!

Remove all the styles you put on the img tag and let's start over, now add this style on the img tags :

```css
border-radius: 30px;
```

Now see the effect it has in the preview...

You can even push it further and put 200px and it will look like a nice "pill".

They are many more css3 styles that we will see later on.

# Shadows !

You have seen the basics of css and now you can make your webpages look much better !
