# Final challenge

For this challenge, we have created for you `index.html` and a css file called `style.css` that is referenced from the `index.html`. They are open on the top left. You can see a preview of the index on the bottom left.

Here are the requirements for the content :

1) Put a font `Arial, sans-serif;` on all the texts using inheritance.
2) Put a `h1` tag with title "My big page"
3) Style the `h1` tag so that it is orange, centered and force capitalization on it.
4) Put two paragraphs underneath it with random text.
5) Style those paragraphs so that they are blue and left aligned.
6) Underneath that, include the 3 images that you will find in the img directory.
7) Finally, put rounded corners on this images and some shadow.

Good luck !
