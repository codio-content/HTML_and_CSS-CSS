# CSS : Cascading Style Sheet

It is a standard language to define and attach visual styles to the elements of an HTML document. So it is a style sheet that you attach to a document to style it.

It is composed of 2 parts :

## The style definition

To define visual properties of HTML elements, example : 
```css
color:red;
font-size:10px;
margin:10px;
```
    
## The selector

To tell the browser which elements these style will apply to, example :

```css
p {
    //all the style definitions inside here 
    //will be applied to the <p> tags in the document.
}

h1 {
    //all the style definitions inside here 
    //will be applied to the <h1> tags in the document.
}
```

We will come back later on term "cascading" in the name, but simply it allow us to "cascade" multiple styles to an element.
