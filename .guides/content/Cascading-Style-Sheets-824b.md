# CSS : Cascading Style Sheet

It is a standard language used to define the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Most of the time used to style web pages written in HTML.

It is composed of 2 parts :

## The style definitions

To define visual properties of HTML elements, example : 
```css
color:red;
font-size:10px;
margin:10px;
```
    
## The selectors

To tell the browser which elements these style will apply to, example :

```css
p {
    //all the style definitions inside here 
    //will be applied to the <p> tags in the document.
}

h1 {
    //all the style definitions inside here 
    //will be applied to the <h1> tags in the document.
}
```

## Play with it

On the top left there is a very simple css file.
On the bottom left a preview of an html file using this css.

Trying changing the `example.css` to see how it affects the page !

For example, on line 3, change the code to : `font-size:48px;`. Then hit the refresh button on the bottom window and see the result !

You can continue and try changing other things ...

When you are done let's continue with some history about CSS.
