But just before that, I'd like to demonstrate the power of css! Let's see how css was used to do the tree view of an html document that we used in the previous section.

Imagine we have this html code :
```html
    <h1> some title </h1>
    <p> some text </p>
    
    <h1> another title </h1>
    <p> another text</p>
    
    <h1> our last title</h1>
    <p> and our last text</p>
```

Nothing fancy, just some titles and some texts.
If we display it without any styling, it should look like this :

<iframe  width="100%" height="70%" src="/tree/empty.html" bgcolor="fff" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Now let see what could be done with css, so we keep exactly the same structure and just add css.Now

<iframe  width="100%" height="80%" src="/tree/withstyle1.html" bgcolor="fff" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And now can get really crazy (try to put your mouse over the elements) :

<iframe  width="100%" height="90%" src="/tree/withstyle2.html" bgcolor="fff" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
